OpenBabel MACCS fingerprint calculation algorithm has some bugs which, at the time of this release, were unresolved.

Due to their nature, these bugs should not have a big effect on decoy sets produced by DecoyFinder, though.

However it is planned to add a diferent bugfree MACCS backend or different types of fingerprint.
