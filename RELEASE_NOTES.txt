OpenBabel has some known bugs which, at the time of this release,
were still not fixed (OpenBabel 2.3.1). The bug reports can be found here:

Due to their nature, these bugs should not have a big impact on decoy sets produced by DecoyFinder, though.

However it is planned to add a diferent bugfree MACCS backend or different types of fingerprint.
